# interview-questions
A series of interview questions for various roles in tech

Inspired by [DevOps Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/spikenode/DevOps-Interview-Questions) and [Front-end-Developers-Interview-Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)

The main difference is that I want questions with specific singular answers to include the answer or linkout to an answer. 
Broad questions encourage discussion but should have followups to focus or coax out knowledge.
